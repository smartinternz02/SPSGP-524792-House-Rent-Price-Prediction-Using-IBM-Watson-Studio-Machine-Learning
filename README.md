This is the Data Analytics project of House predication using Tableau here we segregated all the data of the new house across all the places and made an analysis using the tableau and created the web page using Flask server
The process of estimating the value or price of residential properties based on a variety of factors and data is known as house prediction. It is also referred to as housing market analysis or real estate forecasting. The relevant data can be analyzed and visualized with the help of Tableau, a well-known data visualization tool, to obtain insights and make predictions regarding the housing market.

To collect housing-related data, users of Tableau can import data from spreadsheets, databases, or online platforms and connect to them. This data may include demographic information, economic indicators (such as interest rates and employment rates), property features (such as size, number of bedrooms, and location), and historical sales prices

Tableau is a powerful tool for predicting house prices and analyzing data on the housing market. It helps the real estate industry make better decisions by making it easier to explore, comprehend, and communicate insights from complex datasets thanks to its intuitive interface and visualization capabilities

Flask Framework: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used for building web applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to create server-side functionality for your project.
We publsihed our data analytics project on a Flask server, you make it accessible to users through a web interface or API endpoints. This allows others to interact with our project, input their data, and receive analysis results or insights in real-time

We created a data analytics dashboard.By creating this data analytics dashboard, we enhance the user experience and make it easier for stakeholders to gain insights from our project. They can visualize the data, interact with it, and make data-driven decisions more effectively.
The purpose of a Data-Analytics dashboard is Visual Representation,Data Exploration,Real-time Monitoring,Data Insights
